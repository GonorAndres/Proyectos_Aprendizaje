# Credit Default Prediction Model

> **Transforming Risk Assessment Through Data-Driven Insights**

A high-performance machine learning model that achieves 85.19% accuracy in predicting loan defaults, providing transparent and actionable insights for lending decision-making.

## Resumen
Este proyecto desarrolla un modelo de predicción de incumplimiento crediticio utilizando técnicas avanzadas de modelos lineales generalizados. El modelo alcanza una precisión del 85.19% en la identificación de prestatarios con riesgo de incumplimiento, proporcionando insights transparentes y accionables para la toma de decisiones en préstamos. El documento está escrito en inglés a manera de práctica y con el fin de ampliar el alcance profesional del proyecto. 

## Project Overview

This project develops a sophisticated yet interpretable credit default prediction model using advanced statistical modeling techniques. The model demonstrates exceptional performance with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.8519, placing it in the "excellent" category for credit risk models. There's a pdf-notes, to try to expose thoerical ideas that had been used. ** There's an early notebook versión which focus in business takeawys ans insights on expectations and risk managment. **

### Key Achievements
- **85.19% Accuracy**: Correctly ranks high-risk borrowers above low-risk borrowers
- **Industry-Leading Performance**: Exceeds typical industry benchmarks (75-80%)
- **Full Transparency**: Complete explainability for regulatory compliance
- **Production-Ready**: Immediate implementation pathway for lending operations

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions face the fundamental challenge of lending money profitably while minimizing losses from borrowers who cannot repay their loans. Traditional credit assessment methods often suffer from:

- **Inconsistent Risk Assessment**: Subjective evaluations by different loan officers
- **Hidden Risk Factors**: Important predictors may be overlooked
- **Regulatory Concerns**: Lack of transparency in decision-making processes
- **Lost Revenue**: From preventable defaults and unnecessarily rejected good borrowers

## Dataset

- **Size**: 32,000+ loan records
- **Features**: 15+ variables including borrower demographics, financial metrics, and loan characteristics
- **Target**: Binary classification (Default vs. Non-Default)

### Data Quality Enhancements
- Smart outlier treatment using business logic
- Categorical encoding preserving business meaning
- Resolution of multicollinearity issues
- Systematic handling of missing values

## Key Features & Methodology

### Top 5 Predictive Factors

1. **Debt-to-Income Ratio** (Strongest Predictor)
   - Measures percentage of income going toward loan payments
   - Critical indicator of financial flexibility

2. **Income Level**
   - Total annual income of borrower
   - Non-linear relationship with default risk

3. **Credit Quality Grade**
   - Risk classification (A through E)
   - Reflects overall creditworthiness

4. **Previous Default History**
   - Binary indicator of past defaults
   - Strong predictor of future behavior

5. **Housing Status**
   - Rental vs. ownership status
   - Indicates financial stability and community commitment

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM)
- **Output**: Probability scores (0-1) rather than binary decisions
- **Validation**: Cross-validation and holdout testing
- **Interpretability**: Complete transparency in decision-making process

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Score | Industry Benchmark |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| AUC Score | 0.8519 | 0.75-0.80 |
| Accuracy | 85.19% | 75-80% |
| Category | Excellent | Good-Excellent |

## Business Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- **Risk-Based Pricing**: More accurate loan pricing based on actual risk levels
- **Automated Screening**: Faster processing for high-confidence decisions
- **Enhanced Due Diligence**: Focused manual review for borderline cases

### Strategic Advantages
- **Competitive Edge**: Better pricing for good borrowers while protecting against poor risks
- **Scalability**: Handle increased application volumes without proportional staff increases
- **Continuous Improvement**: Framework allows ongoing refinement with new data

## Risk Management & Governance

### Model Risk Controls
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regular accuracy tracking and drift detection
- **Bias Testing**: Fair lending compliance across all borrower segments
- **Override Protocols**: Clear procedures for human judgment interventions
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive audit trail for regulatory purposes

### Regulatory Compliance
- Uses only legitimate business considerations
- Provides clear explanations for each decision
- Excludes protected class characteristics
- Auditable by third parties

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- **Alternative Data Integration**: Social media, utility payments, mobile data
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Early warning systems for existing borrowers
- **Product Development**: New loan products for specific risk segments
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Advanced analytics for portfolio construction

### Research Directions
- Deep learning architectures for complex pattern recognition
- Ensemble methods for improved robustness
- Explainable AI techniques for enhanced interpretability
- Real-time model updating with streaming data

## Model Interpretability

The model provides complete transparency through:
- **Feature Importance Rankings**: Quantified contribution of each factor
- **Probability Explanations**: Clear reasoning for each prediction
- **Business Logic Mapping**: Direct connection between statistical outputs and business decisions
- **Regulatory Documentation**: Full audit trail for compliance requirements
